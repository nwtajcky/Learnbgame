===========


Functionality
-------------
Calculates the magnitude and angle of 2D vectors.


Inputs
------
- angleInDegrees_in – A flag, indicating whether the angles are measured in radians (which is by default), or in degrees.
- x_in – Array of x-coordinates; this must be a single-precision or double-precision floating-point array.
- y_in – Array of y-coordinates, that must have the same size and same type as x.


Outputs
-------
- angle_out – Output array of angles that has the same size and type as x; the angles are measured in radians (from 0 to 2*Pi) or in degrees (0 to 360 degrees).
- magnitude_out – Output array of magnitudes of the same size and type as x.
