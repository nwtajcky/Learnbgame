ellipse2Poly
============


Functionality
-------------
Approximates an elliptic arc with a polyline.


Inputs
------
- angle_in – Ellipse rotation angle in degrees.
- arcEnd_in – Ending angle of the elliptic arc in degrees.
- arcStart_in – Starting angle of the elliptic arc in degrees.
- axes_in – Half of the size of the ellipse main axes.
- center_in – Center of the ellipse.
- delta_in – Angle between the subsequent polyline vertices. It defines the approximation accuracy.


Outputs
-------
- pts_out – Output vector of polyline vertices.
