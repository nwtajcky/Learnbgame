2. ABOUT
In this folder you will find a collection of seamless bark textures to finish your tree branches in a realistic way. As are the Grove’s twig textures, these bark textures were captured with accurate color and reflectivity in mind. Correct white balance and exposure relative to surfaces of known reflectance make for quality assets that can be used without tweaking. Using quality HDRI lighting together with the Grove provides instant realism.

3. USAGE
The name of the tree species is followed by a number. This number tells you the estimated thickness of the trunk.
