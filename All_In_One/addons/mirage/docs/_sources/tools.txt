Vertex Groups Generate/Update
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. image:: _static/tools_intro.png

Mirage generates vertex groups to store information about the terrain.
These weight groups are also automatically converted into color vertex groups to
use in Cycles. You can use the buttons included in the tools panel to update the
groups after you have made changes to the terrain.

They can also be used to add vertex groups to other meshes, or purely sculpted terrains.



Export Vertex Group to Image
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. image:: _static/vgroups_exported.jpg

Exports a specific mirage vertex group to a greyscale image. Values will range from 0 (black) 
to 1 (white).

The image will contain as many pixels as vertices in the terrain, so the image size 
will be the square root of the vertex count.
For example, a terrain of 65,536 vertices (medium detail) will create vertex group
images of 256x256 pixels.


Export Heightmap
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. image:: _static/export_heightmap.jpg

Export the terrain as a greyscale image. Each value in this image will represent the 
height of a specific vertex in the terrain, with 0 (black) being the lowest point
of the terrain and 1 (white) the highest.

Heightmaps can be edited in any 2D editor (like GIMP and Krita), and they can be imported
into meshes by many 3D editors and applications.

The images are saved as image datablocks in Blender. You can find them by going into
the `UV/Image Editor` and finding the image called "Heightmap".

.. note:: 
   Mirage doesn't support generating heightmaps larger than terrains at the moment.

.. warning::
   Note that the image has a fake user but it is not automatically saved!
   If you donâ€™t pack it or save it to an external file before closing,
   Blender will lose the contents of the image.

   
Export terrain as data
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Export the terrain as a list of heights. 

The exported data is saved as a Text datablock. You can find it by going into the
`Text Editor` and selecting "Terrain_data.py".
