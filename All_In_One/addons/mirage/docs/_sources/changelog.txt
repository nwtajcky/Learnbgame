Changelog
===================================

2.0
-----------------------------------

Presets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- `new` Presets system. Applies only to procedural terrains at the moment.
- `new` Presets can be imported/exported
- `new` 10 default presets included

Procedural Terrains
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- `new` New Terrain algorithm based on Frequency Synthesis. Much more realistic,
  and slightly faster.
- `new` Terrain generation doesn't block the Blender ui anymore, and shows progress
  in two steps. (Mac and Linux only)
- `new` Terrain generation can be canceled (before it's linked to the scene)
- `new` Terrain Features tab. This is where optional terrain effects will live in the ui.
- `new` Slopes Effect

   - Can control intensity for X/Y axis
   - Can set a minimum height for X/Y axis
   - Slope direction can be inverted

- `removed` Initial heights was removed and replaced with the slopes effect.
- `new` Thermal Erosion
   
   - Repose angle (talus) can be modified between common ground values (30-45)
   - Strength of the effect can be controlled

- `new` Stratified effect (strata).

   - Can happen at different frequencies
   - Strength of the effect can be controlled
   - Slope can be inverted (going inwards)

- `changed` Terrain detail now uses a dropdown selector with three levels
  (normal, medium and high) and a custom option.
- `new` Custom detail. Terrains can now have specific number of segments. 

  - Lets the user fine-tune the amount of vertices in the final mesh
  - Custom Base Grid setting lets the user increase the amount of fine detail in the terrain

- `new` Plateau setting. Flattens terrain at a specific height.
- `changed` Terrain is always generated at 0,0 coordinates and is scaled 
  vertically between 0 and max height.
- `changed` Terrain remains at 0,0 coordinates even if sea level is higher than zero
- `new` Alpine setting. Increases difference between valleys and peaks
- `new` Deformation setting. Makes the terrain more "twisty" and adds more ridges
- `changed` Seed values are now positive integers going up to 2,000,000,000
- `new` Smoothed to plane edges now have a "smoothing factor" 
  that determines how much the terrain is smoothed  (works in island too)

Terrains from Heightmaps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- `new` Add preview selector for previous heightmaps
- `fix` Make the file browser show only images when selecting heightmap
- `changed` Move terrain from heightmaps to it's own panel

General UI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- `changed` Group buttons and inputs in the ui
- `changed` Use real world measure units whenever possible in the ui
- `changed` Use 0-10 and 0-5 integer ranges in the ui whenever possible (easier to tweak)
- `new` Set a custom tab for Mirage's panels in Addon Preferences

Tree Distribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- `fix` Disable "Add trees" if no group selected
- `fix` Check if the selected tree group is not empty
- `fix` Use trees rotated on the side to take advantage of Blender's random rotation
- `fix` Make sure tree mesh dimensions are never 0 
  when calculating auto-scale (so billboards can be used)

Tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- `new` Export vertex Groups to image
- `new` Export terrain to data

  - Export as 1D/2D list
  - Export as Python/CSV

- `new` Export to heightmap is now separated into a button

  - Can export heightmaps from any plane-like mesh

- `changed` Heightmaps are now exported in Linear colorspace
