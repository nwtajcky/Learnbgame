Preferences
=================================================================================

When you enable Mirage you will notice a new box below it with the addon
preferences. These options will allow you to customize Mirage to your liking.
At the moment, there's only one setting.

Panel's Tab
	By default all of Mirage's panels go in the "Mirage" tab in 3D view.
	You can type a different name here to change the name of that tab. You
	can also type the name of a tab that already exists (like "Create") to
	put Mirage's panels into it. This allows you to group Mirage with other
	addons or panels, and lower the amount of tabs.
