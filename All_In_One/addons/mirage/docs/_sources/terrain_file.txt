Terrain generated from heightmaps
=================================================================================

This tool uses the displace modifier on a grid mesh to produce a terrain using the
elevation data from a heightmap.

Heightmap File
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This input sets the heightmap image to use. A **heightmap** (also know as heightfield)
is a greyscale image representing elevation data. You can find them online by googling,
or from websites like `Natural Earth <http://www.naturalearthdata.com>`_

.. note:: If you want to know more about heightmaps `check this Wikipedia article.
	  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heightmap>`_

To select a heightmap click the `Select a Heightmap` button and navigate to the file.
Note that once you select a heightmap you will see a preview of it, and the button's
text will change to the name of the image file. You can click the preview to see a
list of heightmaps you have previously loaded.


Common issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	  
Some heightmaps can produce strange artifacts around the edges (see image), this is
a UV issue and can you can fix easily.

Simply enter `edit mode` and go into the `UV/Image editor`, select everything (with
the **a** key) and scale it down just a bit.



General Settings
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Strength
          How strong the displacement is (vertical scale of features)

Size
          Sets the size in real world units

Detail level
          Set vertex count for the base grid (in segments). Note that the grid
	  has to be UV Unwrapped to apply the displacement and this can be
	  slow with high vertex counts.

.. note:: Since this terrain object uses a displacement modifier, you can tweak it
	  after generating it. Check the modifiers tab in the properties editor.
	  Don't forget to update the vertex groups using the Tools panel.
	  You can also change the texture image, by going into the texture tab.
