BlenRig is an Auto-rigging and skinning system that provides the user of a Feature Film quality rig (including an advanced facial system).

The current version only supports Biped characters, but more presets will be supported in the near future.

Rig creation includes:

_BlenRig armature

_BlenRig Mesh Deform cage and Lattices

_Basic body mesh for creating low resolution proxy versions of the characters.


Usage
=====


You will find the rig in the **Object Add Panel**, under the **Armature Menu**.

In this type of computer most rigged high resolution characters will run at 35+ fps. Low resolution proxy versions may run at 50+ fps.
