Special Characters

  \        Escape special characters or start a sequence.

  .        Matches any character. ('.*' matches everything in a name.)

  ^        Matches beginning of string.

  $        Matches end of string.

  [3a-c]   Matches any characters '3', 'a', 'b' or 'c'.

  [^3a-c]  Matches any characters except '3', 'a', 'b' or 'c'.

  a|b      matches either a or b.


Quantifiers

  *        0 or more. (append ? for fewest)

  +        1 or more. (append ? for fewest)

  ?        0 or 1. (append ? for fewest)

  {m}      Exactly m occurrences.

  {m, n}   From m to n, m defaults to 0, n defaults to infinity.

  {m, n}?  From m to n, as few as possible.


Special Sequences

  \A       Start of string.

  \b       Matches empty string at word boundary. (between \w and \W)

  \B       Matches empty string not at word boundary.

  \d       A digit.

  \D       A non-digit.

  \s       Whitespace.

  \S       Non-whitespace.

  \w       Alphanumeric, Same as: [0-9a-zA-Z_]

  \W       Non-alphanumeric.

  \Z       End of name.


Groups

  ()             Creates a capture group and indicates precedence.

  \1             Recall first captured group, change accordingly.

  (?P<name>...)  Creates a group with the id of 'name'.

  \g<id>         Matches a previously defined group.

  (?(id)yes|no)  Match 'yes' if group 'id' matched, else 'no'.


Examples

(1) String: Name.001

    Find: \W[0-9]*$

    Result: Name

    This expression will strip any numbers at the tail end of a name up to and
    including any non-alphanumeric character.

    The individual characters used are;

    \W    Non-alphanumeric. (any character other then [0-9a-zA-Z_])

    [0-9] Character class from range 0 through 9.

    *     Anything preceding this symbol will be matched until no other matches
          are found.

    $     Indicates that we want to start from the end of the string.


(2) String: Name.001

    Find: ([A-z]*\.)

    Replace: Changed_\1

    Result: Changed_Name.001

    This expression will create a capture group of any characters and a . (dot)
    replace those characters with 'Changed_' infront of that captured group.

      The individual characters used are;

      (     Start a capture group.

      [A-z] Character class range A-z (upper and lowercase).

      *     Anything preceding this symbol will be matched until no other
            matches are found.

      \.    Used here to escape the character . (dot) which has special
            meaning in regular expressions.

      )     End a capture group.

      \1    Recall first captured group.


(3) String: Name

    Find: ^((?!Name).)*$

    Replace: Not_Name

    Result: Not_Name

  This expression will actually look ahead in the name and determine if there
  is the string 'Name' in it, if there is then it will be skipped, however if it
  is not there then that name will be entirely replaced with Not_Name. This is
  useful in situations where you want to name everything except those names
  with a specific string in it.



Regular expressions are much like a tiny programming language, this cheatsheet
will help get you started.
