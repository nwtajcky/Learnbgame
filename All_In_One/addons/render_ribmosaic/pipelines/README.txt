This folder contains RIB Mosaic pipelines to be auto-loaded on script startup.
Any pipelines in this folders will always be available in the pipeline manager
and cannot be removed from the GUI. If a pipeline's settings are modified from
within the GUI the Blender's text copy is modified NOT the texts within this
folder (unless the user saves Blender's text). It is also recommended to set any
pipeline placed in this folder to read-only to prevent artists accidentially
modifying core pipelines for distribution.
