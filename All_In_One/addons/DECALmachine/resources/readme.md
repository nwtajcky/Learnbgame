Thank you for your purchase of DECALmachine!


## To provide support, I need

* proof of purchase of DECALmachine
* if you report an ERROR or PROBLEM:
    - attach a screenshot of the terminal/system console
        - just a screenshot of the error message in Blender **may not be enough**
    - attach a screenshot of the terminal/system console right after starting Blender, to verify other addons are not interfering
    * attach a blend file, if it makes sense, keep it under 1MB
    * describe how to reproduce your ERROR/PROBLEM
* pil.log and system_info.txt from this DECALmachine/logs folder


## What's a Terminal/Console?

## Do
