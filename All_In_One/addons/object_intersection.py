#----- updates
#2011-09-22 (Witold Jaworski): reversed sequence of Vector*Matrix multiplication to proper Matrix*Vector    
#2012-04-29 (Witold Jaworski): adaptation for Blender 2.63 (BMesh): using the tessfaces instead of faces collection. 
#2012-09-28 (Witold Jaworski): correction (edges of tessfaces have not normalized edge keys, as faces in 2.49). It lead to discarding
#                              most of the founded points as "diagonals".
#2012-09-29 (Witold Jaworski): Further corrections of other errors (concerned with "gluing" the cross points into edges)
#2012-11-05 (Witold Jaworski): Refactoring the Intersect* operators to enable self-intersection of selected and unselected
#                              faces of a single mesh (invoked from Edit Mode).

####general comments-------------------------------------------------------
#The algorithm for the crossing calculation is following:
#1. Prepare the data - use meshes of selected objects to create two CMesh
#   instances. There no special assumptions about the topology of selected 
#   meshes - they can be a multi-piece mesh, closed or open.
#   Each CMesh stores a list of all faces of assigned object. They are converted
#   into world coordinates and eventually split from quads to triangles. They
#   are the CFace class instances. 
#    We will refer to the CMesh representing the first selected object as mesh A,
#   and the second as mesh B.  
#
#2. For each face from A: check intersection with every face of B faces. Store
#   the found cross points in A.cpoints list. The crossing points are searched
#   first crossing each A's edges (CEdge) with B face triangle. Then the B's 
#      edges are crossed with A's face triangle. There should be always be a zero 
#   or two crossing points (CPoint) found. They are referred to each other, to 
#   allow arrange them into proper loop at the next stage. 
#   (They are found randomly, now, so it is not right place to discover the loop)
#
#3. Arrange the found cross points into properly ordered loops. To find a loop,
#   select the arbitrary (in implementation: first) point from list of found
#   points. Using the references created at 2. find all the ancestors of the 
#   selected point. Then find all precedensors, and connect this two lists
#   to get a complete loop.
#
#
#   In this implementation, to minimize the intersection calculations, first 
#   test is a "box" test: the extents of two faces are compared. Further 
#   calculations are performed only for the faces that have the "box" test 
#   passed.
#      The face's edges (CEdge) are created "on demand", when there is a need to
#   cross them with a face. Many faces will never demand their edges, so they
#   will be never created. Edges, during creation, are referenced by both faces
#   that share it. 
#      This will reduce greatly the number of edges.
#   Each edge "remembers" result of the crossing with each face, so also the
#   calculations with negative result will not be performed twice.
#   In general, this implementation uses heavily the memory, and minimizes
#   the CPU usage as much, as possible. 
#   
#   Below - definitions of four object classes, that take part in the intersection: 
#        CMesh, 
#        CFace, 
#        CEdge, 
#        CPoint (it is the result - cross point, not vertex!)

    """Represents a mesh, one of two used to find the intersection"""

    #private instance fields:
    #__src => Mesh:            Blender's mesh object
    #
    #    working dictionaries, used during intersection:
    #__verts => {Vector}:     a dictionary of mesh vectors - in global space
    #                        coordinates. The key is the Mesh vertex ordinal.
    #__edges => {Edge}:        dictionary of edges, that will be tested.
    #                        The key is a tuple of begin and end vertices 
    #                        ordinals. The smaller ordinal is always the first 
    #                        element    of the tuple key. Initially all values are
    #                        plain indices (integers) to self.__src.edges[] list.                         
    #                        Then, while processing, some of these indices -
    #                        edges that are "suspected" to have a cross
    #                        point with the second mesh - will be replaced with 
    #                        CEdge instances.
    #                        This "suspect" is based on face's spatial
    #                        position. (When they pass the "box" test)
    #__neighbours=>{Face}    dictionary of faces, that form the mesh. In this
    #                        dictionary every face is registered 3 times. (for 
    #                        every edge). The key is a tuple of two edge's 
    #                        vertices ordinals. The sequence of these ordinals 
    #                        matches the direction of the edge along assigned.
    #                        Thus some of these keys will be a reversed version 
    #                        of the keys in the __edges dictionary, the others  
    #                        will be identical.
    #                        For all non-boundary edges there always are two keys,
    #                        one for each face that shares this particular edge.
    #                        The value tuples of such keys are a reversion of 
    #                        each other.
