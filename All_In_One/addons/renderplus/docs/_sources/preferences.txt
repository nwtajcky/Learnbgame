Preferences
===================================

Render+ Preferences appear under the addon details once you enable it in user preferences. Don't forget to save your changes by clicking *"Save  User Settings"*


General Options
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These settings allow you to choose a specific terminal and blender app to use 
for batch. Leave this blank to use the defaults.

- **Custom Blender Command:** Use a specific Blender executable when running batches.

- **Custom Terminal Command:** Use a specific terminal when running batches. Don't forget to include a parameter to run a command (eg. 'xterm -e ').



Notifications
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **Custom Sound:** Set your own sound file to use for notifications. This file can be anything that Blender can play (WAV, MP3, OGG, AIFF). If you want to get the default sound back after you've changed it, right-click the `Custom Sound` input and select *"Reset to Default Value"*
- **Sound Volume:** Set the volume for notifications. Note that the volume is relative to the system/speakers volume.
  
**Email**
  
Before you can use email notifications you need to setup a SMTP server and an email address to send to. 

SMTP stands for *Simple Mail Transfer Protocol*. SMTP servers are used to send and relay emails. If you have a GMail, Yahoo, or Microsoft Live email account you can use the **Quick Setup** button to set it up automatically. Simply add your username and password.

If your email account is provided by a different hosting company, ask your service provider for instructions on how to connect to their SMTP server. Hosting companies usually have this information in a dedicated page in their knowledge base or support sections.

.. warning:: I strongly recommend you don't use your primary email account for this.
	     Blender wasn't built to handle sensitive data, such as your email user and password. Note that your password will be stored without encryption. There is a certain risk that this information could be stolen. Stay safe by using an email account made specifically for notifications.

- **Send to:** Email address to send notification

- **Server:** STMP server to use
- **Username:** Username for SMTP server
- **Password:** Password for SMTP
- **Use SSL:** Enable or disable SSL for SMTP connection


.. _batch-settings:

Batch
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **Show Batch Render Panel:** Toggle the batch rendering ui.

- **Refresh interval:** Specify how often the interface should be updated while a batch is running. The number is in seconds.

- **Automatically create directories when rendering:** If an output path is set to a directory that doesn't exist, try to create it automatically.

- **Use a Custom CSS file for RSS feeds:** Set a specific CSS file to use with Render+'s RSS files. This CSS file will be copied in the same place as the RSS file.


  
Help
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Generate support log:** When this setting is enabled Render+ will record all useful information to a log file. This information makes it faster and easier to fix bugs and solve issues. Don't leave this option on all the time, as the log file can grow very quickly.
- **Support log file:** Determines where the log file is saved.

.. note:: If you are using Windows make sure this is set to a directory that exists and can you have permission to write, **even if the support log is disabled**. Otherwise you'll get errors. It's one of those cases where Windows likes to be "special" and it can't be fixed easily.
