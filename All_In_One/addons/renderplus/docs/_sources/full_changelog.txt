0.8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Major code refactor. All the code is now organized into modules, code duplication has been reduced and error handling is more robust in general.
- Email Notifications. Send an email to notify when a render is complete. Requires an email account to send. 
- Export Stats to CSV. Save stats data as a CSV file for graphs, databases, etc.
- Much improved documentation for users and developers
- New samples for post/pre actions in docs
- Clone override button. Custom Overrides can be quickly copied to all render jobs with one click.
- Most of the code is now unit tested.  
- Colored output in terminal (only Linux)
- Render jobs using external blends no longer require an output path. You can leave it blank to make R+ use the output set in the external blend.
- Generate support log setting. Enabling this feature will write a detailed log file while using R+, useful to help solve issues/bugs.  


0.7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- New batch rendering implementation. No longer freezes the UI!
- Batches run independently of Blender now. You can close, or open another file while the batch is running. It will continue even if Blender crashes.
- The list updates as the batch process each job (whether it's finished or failed)
- Use all scene layers feature has been disabled for now. Something changed in recent releases that has made it stop working and I haven't been able to fix it yet.
- Batches can now be cancelled. Any running jobs will be immediately terminated.
- Refresh interval for the batch panel can be set in the addon preferences 
- Support for external blend files in batch. Scene/camera/render layers don't autocomplete though (API limitations).
- Enable/Disable all options to quickly toggle batch render jobs
- Render jobs can now be renamed by double clicking on their name in the list
- You can also toggle between animation and still renders by clicking the icon in the list
- Option to ignore Render Border setting in batch
- Option to write log files for each render job
- Global size setting for batches. This size will override any size you have set for render jobs, as well as the size you have set in the output panel. Useful to make quick previews.
- All messages printed to the console now have timestamps
- Log files for background jobs and batches include timestamps. Batches include the render job number and batch name.
- Size percentage (from the output panel) is now ignored in batch to avoid user mistakes. If you need to change the size for all jobs you can use the new global size setting.
- RSS file support. Render+ can now generate an RSS file for each batch, so you can monitor it's progress. If you put this file in a network or Dropbox folder, you can monitor the batch using your tablet/phone/TV/browser/etc. See the docs for more info.
- Render jobs can have specific file formats. (format specific options not available yet though)
- Render jobs can use a specific number of threads (use 0 for automatic)
- Custom overrides for render jobs. 
- Render+ will now check for conflicting or invalid output paths in the batch list
- Animation jobs can now render specific Render Layers
- The "Cycle slots" toggle has been replaced by the Slots menu. Cycle slots never worked quite well because of API issues and it wasn't very useful. The new slots menu allows you to change slots from the render panel, as well as  name them. Used slots have a fully visible icon, free slots have a more transparent one.
- Render jobs must have different names now. This was preferred before, but now it's enforced due to the possibility of bugs and data conflicts.
- Render+ will warn about invalid scenes, cameras or combinations of both. Previous behaviour was using the default scene/camera but this was frustrating (specially in long batches :) )
