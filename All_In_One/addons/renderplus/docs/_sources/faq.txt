Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
===============================================================================

**Q: I sometimes get a message about a "state file gone" in the console. What does it mean?**

This means Render+ can't find a state file for the current blender file. This
can happen when cancelling or switching to a different file because Render+ is
still trying to read the state file before it realizes the batch is no longer
running, or the blend has changed. 

You can safely ignore this if you cancelled a batch, or switched to another
blend file. Otherwise, post a message in the support forums!


**Q: The Custom Overrides help says data paths need to be relative to "bpy.context.scene". What does that mean?**

Check the section about custom overrides above and the Blender documentation
about data paths. http://www.blender.org/api/blender_python_api_2_72_0/info_api_reference.html


**Q: The post/pre actions help says I should use absolute paths. What are absolute paths?**

Absolute paths are file paths starting from the root of the filesystem. 
From "C:\" in Windows, or "/" in OS X/Linux. For instance: "/home/user/documents/render/image.png"



**Q: What does "overrides" mean (for batch renders)?**

Overrides are properties (like render dimensions, or the scene) that can be
modified in a render job.


**Q: When I start a batch I get an error message about a batch temporary folder being missing or not writable. How can I fix that?**

You may have accidentally deleted or changed the permissions of the batch 
temporary folder in the renderplus directory. Render+ will try to create
the folder if it doesn't find it, but if permissions don't allow it to write
it will not be able to do it. To fix this check permissions of the Render+
folder and the batch temporary folder (if present).


**Q: Some of my render jobs fail with a "Permission Denied" error. What's the issue?**

Check the output path for your render jobs. Make sure you have write permissions
on that folder.


**Q: My renders are coming out blank/wrong in batch!**

Do you have more than one render layer? In that case you need to select a specific render
layer in the batch panel. Otherwise the last layer to get rendered will
overwrite the rest.


**Q: I'm getting a lot of strange "Success"/"Error" messages when cancelling batches in Windows.**

That's normal (really!). In order to cancel the batch process in Windows we need
to call another program to kill the processes and that's what prints those messages.
They can be safely ignored.


**Q: When I select a format override in batch I get a message about that format 
not being available in my system.**

This happens when you select a format that may or may not be compiled into
Blender. Render+ can't determine which formats were included in your Blender
version (API limitation). Available formats can vary between Operating Systems
and versions of Blender (official, custom, branch from GraphicAll, etc).

If you're unsure about a format being available, try a small render using the
size override to check it out.
