* add alternative handle creation method create_intersection_handles(), based on projected loops interecting implicit faces create from the average normals of v.link_faces
* add alternative unchamfer() utilizing the intersection handles
* add unchamfer method selection
* make new unchamfer method primary
* disable force_projected in get_loops() for the new method
* add fallback to create_intersection_handles() which uses the old create_handles() for each failing caseA
* remap the average/center value used to lerp between the two handle locations in unchamfer_intersection()
* optionally add MESHmache menu to Specials menu
* add the new handle method for fuse and unfuse
* remove boundary rail bweigths and set sweep beweights according to biggest value of loop edges
* move segments > 0 check to the beginning
* fix issue when trying to sett beweight, while both loop edges were projected (and so no longer exist)
* break out of biggles_angle_loop() if the two top angles are too close together
