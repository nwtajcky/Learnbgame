* Plug()
        - add "global" deformation toggle
                - intended for cases, where you know you are working on flat geometry but the plugs are complex and have a deformer with use_deformer toggled on, perhaps even with subsets set to forcesubsetdeform
                - you can just toggle off all deformation in that case, even for fillet plugs and speed up the plug tool considerably 
        - store handle scale
        - store local empty location
        - add simple subdivision to the cointainer, to avoid rare bug in negative corners, where faces to replace are found outisde the container cut

* InsertPlug()
	- check if plug scale is stored and set it accordingly
        - check if empty locations are stored and set them accordingly

* ValidatePlug()
        - add flipped normals check
        - always automatically deselect handle polyons
        - always generate unique UUIDs for emtpies, when they aren't set

* AddPlugToLibrary()
        - add mode selection and with it ability to replace existing plugs
                - useful to update plugs, without having to manually remove the previous version

* MyPlugs plugs
	- add Blender logo plug to previously empty library
