* add Boolean Cleanup tool
	- used to fix verts of an edge loop in place based on connected edges on the selected side
	- merge the other verts based on a threshold
	- can be used on cyclic and non-cyclic edge selections
* add Chamfer tool
	- per side loop slide toggle
	- 2 face methods:
		- REBUILD with the optional Merge Perimeter prop
		- REPLACE with the Reach prop
	- the methods are different ways of dealing with geometry outside of the chamfer, which the chamfer may overlap depending on the width
	- REBUILD should be used if the chamfer doesnt or only minimally overlaps
	- REPLACE can be used if the chamfer overlaps a lot
