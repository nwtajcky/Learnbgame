* added Normal Flatten tool
	- used to fix shading issues, especially for ngons, that should be flat
	- has angle threshold value and presets
	- only boundary faces angled below the threshold are taken into account
	- boundary faces separated by a sharp edge are also ignored
	- has “clear existing normals” toggle, which is as if the the Normal Clear tool were to be run before running Normal Flatten
* added Normal Straighten tool
	- used to fix angular shading on straight sections of Fuse/Bevel/Bridge surfaces
	- its effect is less noticable than Normal Flatten, but its something hat can be done in the pursuit of normal perfection
* added Normal Clear tool
	- does not remove split normal data completely like Blender’ss customdata_custom_splitnormals_clear() operator does
	- instead works on the selection only
* improved handling of an issue in Unfuse
