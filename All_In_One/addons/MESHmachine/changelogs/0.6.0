* Fuse
	- only draw self.capholes in HUD, if not self.cyclic
* Refuse
	- add force_projected_loop support
* Flatten
	- add 1,2 scrolling
* Unchamfer
	- add bweight and bweights props in draw()
* Unfuck()
	- fix issue where the handle1co and handle2co wouldn't update properly when the width is changed, because the original end points were used for intersect_point_line() instead of the adjustted start1co and start2co
* TurnCorner
	- set smoothing based on initially selected face
* QuadCorner
	- lower width min prop
	- only draw self.tension in HUD, if not self.single

* Plug and DrawPlug
	- use utils.normal.normal_clear_across_sharps() instaed of various vertex group ops, to clear normals acress sharps
		- hide plug type selection in draw()
	- fix issue with cointain amount not taking into account plug and target scale
* MyPlugs library
	- fix contain issue in 001_Blender plug, as a result of the latest Plug() changes

* CreateStash
	- fix exception when pressing d in modal(), when stash has not been created from other object, and so sources was not defined
	- allow d key presses to pass through, if there are no sources or if alt, shift, ctrl is pressed
	- set MM.isstashobj prop
* ViewStashes
	- when retrieving a stashe, only transfer stashes when the stash matrix == target matrix at the time the stash was created
	- undo stash naming when retrieving a stash
	- unset MM.isstashobj prop when retrieving
* TransferStashes
	- move retrieve and restashing to utils.stash.transfer_stashes()
        - add prop to enable retieval and restashing
		- useful for transfering stashes to plug subsets
		- also useful for transfering stashes to duplicate object with applied scale/rotation
* ClearStashes and RemoveOrphanStashes
	- add deletion counter title
* Conform
	- make sure stashobjs matrix == active obj's matrix
		- this means you can move and rotate an object with stashes, and conform will keep working
* add ViewOrphanStashes()
	- view and retrieve orphan stashes
* add RemoveOrphanStashes()
	- removes objects with MM.isstashobj prop and use_face_user props being True and users prop being 1

* BooleanCleanup
	- add poll()
	- add 1,2 scrolling
* Chamfer
	- rename Normal Transfer VGroup stuff to just Vertex Group
	- name the actual vgroup "chamfer"
	- add 1,2 scrolling
* Offset
	- rename Normal Transfer VGroup stuff to just Vertex Group
	- name the actual vgroup "offset"
	- add 1,2 scrolling

* NormalTransfer
	- automatically clear normals across sharp edges, if limit_by_sharps props is True
		- experimental
* NormalClear
	- change prevent_sharp_edges to limit_to_selection

* Symmetrize
	- redo normal transfer without stashes
* Real Mirror
	- fix parenting issues by simplifiying using matrix math
  
* Looptools Wrappers
	- remove UP_ARROW and DOWN_ARROW
* VSelect
	- add ONE and TWO keys

* properties.py
	- save stash matrix in object.MM.stashmx and stash target matrix in object.MM.stashtargetmx instead of on the stashes
	- this is necessary for the retrieval of orphan stashes
	- remove obsolete location, rotation and scale props for stashes, it's all done via matrices now
	- rename MM.isstash to MM.isstashobj
* utils.core.init_sweeps()
	- fix "mark loop"/freestyle issue, where single loop edges weren't expluded when marked
* utils.normal.py
       	- move normal functions from ops over here
	- add normal_transfer_from_obj() and normal_transfer_from_stash()
* utils.stash.create_stash()
	- always set the stashmx and stashtargetmx props
	- this way, you can properly retrieve orphan stashes at the location they were created at
* utils.stash.transfer_stashes()
	- add restash arg + logic
 * utils.ui.py
	- in draw_init() and draw_prop() support modal_hud_scale and user_preferences.view.ui_scale

* UI
	- improve stash idx HUD display in NormalTransfer(), Conform(), ViewStashes and ClearStashes()
	- remove modal HUD positioning options
	- add modal_hud_scale prop
	- remove adddon warning
